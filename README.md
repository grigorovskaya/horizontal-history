# horizontal-history

This project was done as a part of learning how to code. The idea was to visualize lifespans of historically significant people, to help better understand the dominant set of ideas and actions that were important during any given time period. My inspiration came from Wait But Why post on horizontal history (http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/01/horizontal-history.html) - if you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend you do, because it's awesome. 

I used as much vanilla JS as possible, writing helper functions from scratch in most cases, etc. I used d3 for visualizing the chart, but everything else including legend was made with pure JS.

I knew close to nothing about coding as anyone can possibly imagine before I started working on this project, and there are already many things I'd like to clean up and/or change, but I'll leave it here for now.
