# horizontal-history
my very first javascript project

This project was done as a part of learning to code. The idea was to use as much vanilla JS as possible, writing helper functions from scratch in most cases, etc. I used d3 for visualizing the chart, but the legend is made with pure JS.
The project theme was inspired by Wait But Why post about horizontal history and my deep admiration for both history and infographics.
I knew as close to nothing about coding before I started working on this project as anyone can possibly imagine, so I might change something later as I'll keep learning.
