# horizontal-history
my very first javascript project

This project was done as a part of learning to code. The idea was to visualize lifespans of historically significant people, to help better understand the dominant set of ideas and actions that were important during any given time period. My inspiration came from Wait But Why post on horizontal history (http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/01/horizontal-history.html) - if you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend you do, because it's awesome. 

I used as much vanilla JS as possible, writing helper functions from scratch in most cases, etc. I used d3 for visualizing the chart, but everything else including legend was made with pure JS.

I knew as close to nothing about coding before I started working on this project as anyone can possibly imagine, so I might change something later as I keep learning.
